I (try to) write a lot of unit tests in my various projects, and use a lot of mocks. The problem with mocks is that they
tend to be totally disconnected from the implementation they represent.

Because a subject's behavior is described by the tests using it, how can we be sure that it does represent how the real
implementation will behave ?

That's how Contract based testing, and Mesmaeker, can help. The basic idea goes like this. Say you have a class A, and a
class B using instances of A. When testing B, instead of using subject instances of A, that will behave to make the tests of
B pass, you're going to use a subject generated by a Contract class. And when you're testing class A, you can use the contract
class to verify that the implementation follows the same contract as the mocks.
